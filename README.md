# iWilks

Simple iPhone application to calculate a Wilks score.

In Powerlifting, a Wilks Score is used to compare lifters of different bodyweights to determine who is an overall better lifter. To find this, a Wilks Coefficient is calculated and multiplied by the total weight lifted (in the squat, bench, and deadlift). The coefficient is determined based on bodyweight and gender.
